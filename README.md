# has-visited-end-context
LuckPerms context to check for the `minecraft:end/root` advancement.

This plugin was made as a one-off for a friend. **Issues and pull requests submitted to this repository will be ignored**.

This was also largely based upon [LuckPerms/ExtraContexts](https://github.com/LuckPerms/ExtraContexts). Thank you for your work.

If you're looking to replicate this in a different way, you can use LuckPerms [LuckPerms/ExtraContexts](https://github.com/LuckPerms/ExtraContexts) and [PAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/). Then, just check to see if the `%Advancements_end/root%` placeholder is true.
